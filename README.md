# indy-did-resolver
Proof of Concept resolver for the [did:indy method](https://hyperledger.github.io/indy-did-method/).

The code depends on [indy-vdr](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-vdr) and could be merged ideally in the longterm.

This software could be used as a driver for the [Universal Resolver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver).
