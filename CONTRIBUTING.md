## Legal stuff

### Sign your work

This project also tracks patch provenance and licensing using the Developer
Certificate of Origin and Signed-off-by tags initially developed by
the Linux kernel project.

Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

With the sign-off in a commit message you certify that you authored the
patch or otherwise have the right to submit it under an open source
license. The procedure is simple: To certify above Developer's
Certificate of Origin 1.1 for your contribution just append a line

```text
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

to every commit message using your real name or your pseudonym and a valid
email address.

If you have set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs you can
automatically sign the commit by running the git-commit command with the
`-s` option.  There may be multiple sign-offs if more than one developer
was involved in authoring the contribution.

For a more detailed description of this procedure, please see
[SubmittingPatches][] which was extracted from the Linux kernel project,
and which is stored in an external repository.

### Individual vs. Corporate Contributors

Often employers or academic institution have ownership over code that is
written in certain circumstances, so please do due diligence to ensure that
you have the right to submit the code.

If you are a developer who is authorized to contribute to IDUnion on behalf of your employer, then please use your corporate email address in the
Signed-off-by tag, otherwise use a personal email address.
